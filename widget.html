                Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                A heart attack (myocardial infarction) happens 
                when one or more areas of the heart muscle don't 
                get enough oxygen. This happens when blood flow 
                to the heart muscle is blocked.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Causes of a Heart Attack
            </h2>
            <p>
                The blockage is caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries (atherosclerosis). Plaque is made up 
                of deposits, cholesterol, and other substances. When a plaque breaks (ruptures), a blood clot quickly 
                forms. The blood clot is the actual cause of the heart attack.
            </p>
            <p>If the blood and oxygen supply is cut off, muscle cells of the 
                heart begin to suffer damage and start to die. Irreversible 
                damage begins within 30 minutes of blockage. The result 
                is heart muscle affected by the lack of oxygen no longer works
                as it should.
